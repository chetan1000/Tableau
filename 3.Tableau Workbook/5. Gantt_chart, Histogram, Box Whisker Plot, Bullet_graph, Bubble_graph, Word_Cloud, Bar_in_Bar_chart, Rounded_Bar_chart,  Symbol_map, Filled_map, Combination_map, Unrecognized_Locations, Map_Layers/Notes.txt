Gantt chart -list of events against a timeline
connect to build a house dataset
1) bring category on my row shelf
2) bring my start date on column shelf
3)then right click on date and arrange it as per exact value
4) i have to put my duration on my size shelf
5) then i can color my chart based on category
6) i have to goto my category and arrange the order based on field (start date ) and select minimum value
Tableau will give us a gannt chart 

Histogram
use coffee chain data
Objective: to perform distributive analysis
1 measure is enough( sales is enough or profit is enough)
Drag sales onto row shelf.Tableau will create by default sales bin with specificsize( 34.3)
if we want to manually change the bin size then , go to sales measure and click on create bin(with size 60)
drag this newly created bin onto my canvas ,Then if we want to convert the resultant figure into histogram , increase bar size or change sales bin to discrete data type
bins can be created only on measures

Box and whisker plot- distribution analysis on data
use sample superstore
divide data into 4 quartiles
Business Problem: discount being offered across different regions and segments
5 point chart(min value , max value, median, q1 and q3)
q1 is known as lower hinge(lower quartile)
q3 is known as upper hinge(upper quartile)
from minimum to upper hinge 75 percentile of data is concentrated
from minimum to lower hinge 25 percentile of data is concentrated
box will contain 50% of data distribution- it is nothing but peak in the data( middle 50% of data )
any outliers will be outside of box and whiskers
lenght of whiskers -data within 1.5times the interquartile range
interquartile range(iqr) =q3-q1
length of upper whisker= q3+1.5*iqr (>=this value will be an outlier)
length of lower lower whisker= q1-1.5*iqr


Bullet graph- strictly 2 measures (select profit vs budgeted profit)
1)connect to your coffee chain database
2)Drag profit and budget profit onto canvas and select bullett graph
3)Blue bar is my budget profit (258,760), actual profit will be my reference line (259,543)
4) Overall result is - Actual profit > budget profit(this is good result), If i dig deeper and do a market analysis , i can say that my southern region the worst performing region and my east region was very good.
5)60% of target , 80% of target can also be seen in my bullett graph for reference


Bubble chart- control size and color
negative profit cannot be represented with negative area
there use profit on color shelf, and sales on size as sales cannot be negative
number of bubbles will be determined by sub categorie elements
1) Drag profit onto row shelf
2) Drag subcategory onto column shelf
3) Goto show me panle and select packed bubbles
4)Drag your profit onto your color shelf 
5)Drag your sales onto your size shelf


Word Cloud
Select State and Sales as dimension and measure 
Goto show me panel and select tree map
select text in place of automatic from marks shelf
word cloud is ready

Bar in bar chart
put subcategory in columns and sales in row shelf
drag profit and put it on canvas secondary y axis
go to all and then select bar graph from marks shelf
then reduce the size of profit pill and sort it based on profit or sales

Rounded Bar chart
Put subcategory on rows sales on columns
create 0 field in column shelf
put that 0 field on x axis, then select line chart from marks field
put measure names on path
then edit axis and set fixed at 0 
goto label and select show mark labels and deselct end of line 


Maps
Geographic field -will be identified with the help of a globe icon
Geographic field could be country , state, city etc 

if we want plot our geographic data, simply drag country , state city on my canvas

Geographic Roles
1)it is associated region , city , state etc, zip codes(for india postal codes were added in version 10, Airports came up in version 10 of tableau). 
2)They are all recognized on the basis of latitudes and longitudes. they are stored in tableau repository in documents, we can create new geographic roles and also from existing ones , and also we can create new ones
3)we can also convert a geographica role into non-geographic role , we can simply plot airports on a map if your dataset has airports
4)also it recognizes area codes in USA (CBSA.MSA) -core based satistical area/ metropolitran statistical area
 similary we have county , congressional district levels in USA

*be careful of cities (memphis in egypt or memphis in Tenesse in USA), therefore provide parent information like which country, which state and then followed by which city , otherwise it will provide error called ambiguity

Drag country onto shelf for tableau to understand which country you are talking about(when you drag the country , automatically latitude and ,longitude are placed respectively in column and row shelf)

Symbol maps
Tableau by default will create symbol maps
Tableau using a dot wich is a filled in circle is called your symbol map
we can contol both size and color that is 2 measures ( i can control size with help of sales and color with help of profits)
Ex:You can make use of a pie chart if you want to know at catgeory level(furtniture, office supplies , technology)
if you want to know also about profit , you can do it (combined maps)

Combined maps
1)drag country and state on the shelf
2)increase the circle size 
3)drag sales onto size shelf in marks card
4)drag category onto color shelf in marks card, change the chart type to pie
5)then if we want to creat a combine map to include profits , then drag latitude and put it on row shelf
6)convert your graph on top by removing sales and adding profits to color shelf , after that replace the type of chart with filled map
7)once you have the filled map , combine both the maps with the help of dual axis 

Filled Maps
1)simply go to show me panel and select filled maps or i can do the same thing from marks card
2)Maximum we can show only 1 measure on filled map( that is because we can control only paramter which is color )
3)Tableau doesnot give a filled map for city geographic level

Editing unrecognized locations
connect to global superstore
If there is ambiguity , try to enter latitude and longitude
Take care of spelling mistakes( Bengaluru, if you bangalore)

Layers
1)By default it will show country border ,state borders, lakes etc.
2)If you wnat more layers , go to map options and select layers, then you are free to choose from the available layers
3)Depending on the zoom level of map some layers will be active and inactive
click on zoom level , max 16 levels of zoom you have 
4)we can also add data layers, specific to  usa( population , per capita income)
ex: population layer
5)At any point in time ,we can show one data layer
