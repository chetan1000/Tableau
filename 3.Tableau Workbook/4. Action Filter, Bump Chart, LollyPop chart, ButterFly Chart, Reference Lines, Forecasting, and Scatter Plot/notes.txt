Bump chart
It is a line chart where the rank changes based on time line
connect to global superstore
rank of markets will change with time (for example sales across these markets with time)
steps
put order date onto column shelf
sales onto row field
Market into colors shelf
right click on sales and select quick table calculation and rank and then select compute using market
then change sales type to dicrete and change chart type in marks card to line

Butterfly chart
connect to coffe chain dataset
put state on rows
put profit and budget profit onto columns
click on axis of profit and selct reverse
create calculated field with name zeroaxisand enter value 0
drop this zeroaxis between profit and budget profit
click on zeroaxis pil and bring state onto text field
change the chart type to text
lets hide state headers, and drag your profit on color shelf and budget profit onto color shelf


Reference lines
1) simply go to axis and click on add reference line, this will help us draw a line
Reference lines, bands, distribution can be used based on the business logic, they are usely used for benchmarking

Forecasting-Predicting futre trends, estimating future trends given the past (Historic) Data
Time series
use historic data -2015, 2016, 2017, 2018
connect to sample store for this exercise
Ex: Business was established 4 years ago , what will be my profit in 2019 of superstore , given historic data
You can predict sales, profit, 
1) create time series chart or line chart (x axis shoudld be time)
by default it is exponential smoothing- more importance is given to 2018 and least weightage is given to 2015
EX : profit(2019)= 0.8*profit(2018)+ 0.6*profit(2017)+...(tableau will take care of the weights)
You can ignore the last month or inlcude it based on business logic
confidence interval (we cannot be 100% perfect) so we go for 95% confidence level( there is 95% chance)

Scatter plot - Correlation analysis
1)It will comment on the direction of relationship
2)strength of the relationship
Linear trend line- equation of straight line(y=mx+c), y here is profit(it should always be on y axis)
x here is sales (it should always be on x axis )y= f(x), profit= f(sales), Rsquare 0.22, it is not a great model, i converted my model from linear to power , R square improved to 0.78
c is y intercept
p value <0.05 is allowed, confidence level is 95%

what will be output when given input is provided
Ex: what will be theweight gained given calories consumed
Ex: what will be the profit given sales is 100k
wind speed vs power output
